DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE TO ANTI-PROMOTE uwu big brain club, is that a word?
I couldn't think of anything, but... you know... anti-promotion is like the 
reverse of promotion, like, when you anti-promote something you're trying to
get people to hate it, or just like it less, so if you used this website to 
say, for instance, that uwu big brain club is a group full of losers, you would
be 100% right, but it would be a violation of this license.
